# AWS Threat Modelling App Deployed to AWS ECS with Terraform and Github Actions

This project builds upon Amazon's open-source Threat Composer Tool, extending it into a production-ready deployment on AWS. It showcases a containerised Node.js application hosted on ECS Fargate, with infrastructure as code managed via Terraform and automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

## Overview
- Automated infrastructure provisioning
- CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployments
- Dockerised application running on AWS ECS
- HTTPS access enabled through an Application Load Balancer and ACM
- DNS management via Route 53

## Key Components
### Docker
- `Dockerfile` in the `app/` directory defines how the application is built into a container.

### Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- **ECS Fargate** â€“ hosts the application container.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** â€“ routes traffic to your ECS service.
- **Route 53** â€“ manages the domain.
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** â€“ provides SSL certificates.
- **Security Groups** â€“ control inbound and outbound access.
- **VPC** â€“ includes public subnets, an Internet Gateway, and a NAT Gateway.
- **Remote State** â€“ stored in an S3 bucket with state locking for safety.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **Docker workflows** â€“ build and scan Docker images.
- **ECR workflows** â€“ push images to Amazon ECR.
- **Terraform workflows** â€“ run `plan`, `apply`, and optionally `destroy` infrastructure.

# AWS Threat Modelling App Deployed to AWS ECS with Terraform and Github Actions

This project builds upon Amazon's open-source Threat Composer Tool, extending it into a production-ready deployment on AWS. It showcases a containerised Node.js application hosted on ECS Fargate, with infrastructure as code managed via Terraform and automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

## Overview
- Automated infrastructure provisioning
- CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployments
- Dockerised application running on AWS ECS
- HTTPS access enabled through an Application Load Balancer and ACM
- DNS management via Route 53

## Local app setup ðŸ’»

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
yarn global add serve
serve -s build

Then visit:

Or use:
yarn global add serve
serve -s build
```

## Key Components
### Docker
- `Dockerfile` in the `app/` directory defines how the application is built into a container.

### Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- **ECS Fargate** â€“ hosts the application container.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** â€“ routes traffic to your ECS service.
- **Route 53** â€“ manages the domain.
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** â€“ provides SSL certificates.
- **Security Groups** â€“ control inbound and outbound access.
- **VPC** â€“ includes public subnets, an Internet Gateway, and a NAT Gateway.
- **Remote State** â€“ stored in an S3 bucket with state locking for safety.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **Docker workflows** â€“ build and scan Docker images.
- **ECR workflows** â€“ push images to Amazon ECR.
- **Terraform workflows** â€“ run `plan`, `apply`, and optionally `destroy` infrastructure.

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Docker Build and Push**
   - Builds the Docker image.
   - Runs a security scan using Trivy.
   - Pushes the image to Amazon ECR.

2. **Terraform Plan**
   - Initializes the Terraform configuration (`terraform init`) and generates an execution plan (`terraform plan`).
   - Validates configuration with TFLint.
   - Performs a security scan using Checkov.

3. **Terraform Apply**
   - Applies the Terraform configuration to create or update infrastructure.
   - Deploys the ECS service, Application Load Balancer, Route 53 records, and ACM certificate.

4. **Terraform Destroy**
   - Tears down all Terraform-managed resources when they are no longer needed.
